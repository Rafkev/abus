A bus reservation system written in C language
This program allows users to book seats on a bus, view available seats, and cancel reservations.

In this program:

I used an array seats to represent the availability of seats on the bus. Each element in the array corresponds to a seat, and false indicates that the seat is available, while true indicates that it is booked.
I provided options for viewing available seats, booking a seat, canceling a booking, and exiting the program.
The displaySeats, bookSeat, and cancelBooking functions handle the corresponding functionalities.
The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

Please note that this is a basic example for demonstration purposes. In a real-world bus reservation system, you might need additional features such as user authentication, payment processing, seat selection, and more sophisticated data storage and retrieval mechanisms.
